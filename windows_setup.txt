WINDOWS SETUP

Get:
    1.  WSL Ubuntu
    2.  Windows terminal (set default to wsl ubuntu)  - NO GOOD YET, use mintty
    4.  Remap CAPS to ESC with https://github.com/ililim/dual-key-remap/releases

WSL/MINTTY
    - Download mintty
    - Get copy gruvbox theme into `config` file:
        - https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib/blob/master/mintty/gruvbox.minttyrc
        - C:\Users\timle\AppData\Roaming\wsltty\config
    - Set options like you want (or wait and get the config file from dotfiles):
        - Block Cursor
        - 11pt DejaVu Sans Mono Font
        - All shortcut boxes ticked
        - Disable bell ticks by:
        - No scroll bar
    - [DEPRICATED]: Make directory in windows user space to act as linux home dir
        - [WHY]:
            - Most of that stuff is linux specific.
            - things that are required accross multiple systems are stored in `Documents/linux-shared-resources`

    Inside Linux
        - Fix WSL mounts of external drives (eg /c/ not /mnt/c/) and file permissions by copying `etc_wsl.conf`
        into place at `/etc/wsl.conf`  (instructions in `setup.sh`)
        - Change your home dir in `etc/passwd`
        - Reboot

    3.  Carry on as ususal in Linux:
        - Install miniconda
        - Get Dotfiles
        ... etc
